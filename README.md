# Lunar Apostles

Makes pillars optional and each pillar takes you to fight a different apostle (lunar scav). Adds new abilities to each of the 4 twisted scavengers to make each unique. The names don't matter since abilities are changed after activating the pillar. Could use more tweaks/polish. No idea if it works in multiplayer.

TODOS:
- reset scav abilities after each pillar
- Tweak apostles as needed
- Add a reward for fighting the miniboss
- Add curse damage persistence
