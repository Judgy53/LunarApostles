# Lunar Apostles

Makes pillars optional and each pillar takes you to fight a different apostle (lunar scav). Adds new abilities to each of the 4 twisted scavengers to make each unique. HP has been halved. The names don't matter since abilities are changed after activating the pillar. Prevents drones from going to the scav arena. Teleports you back to the rescue ship after completing a boss. Could use more tweaks/polish. No idea if it works in multiplayer. Probably bugged somewhere (regular scavs might be borked) but im sleepy.

TODOS:

- Make pillars consistent
- Tweak apostles as needed
- Add a reward for fighting the apostles
- Add curse damage persistence
