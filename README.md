# Lunar Apostles

Makes pillars optional and each pillar takes you to fight a different apostle that rewards you with an item/pearl. Adds new abilities to each of the 4 unique twisted scavengers.

TODOS:
- Attach set_scene event to pillars
- Return players back to the pillar after completing the boss
- Change lunar scav bag to regular
- Finish Twiptwip
- Finish Guragura

looks like theyre linked so changing 1's abilities changes em all even if i clone, will change as you "enter" the pillars
also the names dont even matter since itll change based on the pillar
