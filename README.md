# Lunar Apostles

Makes pillars optional and each pillar takes you to fight a different apostle (lunar scav) that rewards you with an item/pearl. Adds new abilities to each of the 4 twisted scavengers to make each unique. The names don't matter since abilities are changed after activating the pillar. Could use more tweaks/polish.

TODOS:
- Attach set_scene event to pillars
- Return players back to the pillar after completing the boss
- Add a reward for defeating the boss
- Finish Guragura
